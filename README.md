There's an issue with the code. You may need to hot-reload the app 1-2 times for it to work properly.
Additionally, it's a very basic app since it was created within the constraints of a single day.
If given a considerable amount of time, it can look pretty nice, somewhat like InShorts, but with a minimal look to it.
Also, it looks much better on iOS currently, as it is tested only on iPhone yet.
